My laptop broke in half (not enough duct tape) so I couldn't finish the task sorry!
I originally finished the core but had issues with the same object being reused
so a card's defense value would keep on decreasing instead of resetting to its original value
so I stripped it back down to running once. I was planning on creating a person class to 
create copies of the object and simulate it to create stats
